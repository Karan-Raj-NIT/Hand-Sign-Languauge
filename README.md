# Hand-Sign-Recognition
Hand sign Recognition of the MNIST data set
We will be using a CNN model on the MNIST data for hand sign recognition.
The images are greyscaled and have 28 * 28-pixel dimensions.
We will create numpy arrays and then use the model to train for the 25 classes of the sign language.
We have used matplotlyb.pyplot to view the data, numpy for arrays and keras to create the CNN model
